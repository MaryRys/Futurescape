# Futurescape

Futurescape is an application that utilizes Bungie's Destiny API to display player information and organize Destiny's Triumphs by order of importance to the user. In order to log in, the user must know their Bungie Id. From there they will recognize their (up to 3) playable characters and a list of all triumphs available to complete in destiny.
